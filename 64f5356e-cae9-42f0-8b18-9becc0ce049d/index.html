data-reactid="48"><p>JOHN RODRIGUEZ AND LISA ENDERSBY        · 8 MIN READ</p><p><i><a href="http://studentaffairsfeature.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/The-2015-Student-Affairs-Feature.pdf">Also available on Apple iBooks (Search The 2015 Student Affairs Feature)</a></i></p><p>When we think of training and development for our professional and paraprofessional staff teams, we often find that there is not enough time in the day to create, and facilitate, a schedule that is simultaneously stimulating, engaging, and powerful. In student affairs, these adjectives are used interchangeably and far too often. This is especially true when attempting to validate the facilitation of a specific training topic or session. What if we could use technological (online) freeware and social media platforms to enhance the training experience, lessen the amount of “in-house” training, conserve resources, and maximize efficiency in collecting data, while maintaining a balance with more traditional methods of training? How could this impact our productivity and professional development?</p><p>Living in the digital age, we are pressured to uphold a specific expectation. Whether we are still getting our feet wet or jumping in headfirst, we are expected to conform to the way we perceive the majority of our students communicate with each other. Take a minute to think about your professional experience in relation to training and development. How many sessions, presentations, and slides could have been approached differently or removed from the training schedule? Could these different approaches include the use of technology?</p><p>Institutions of higher learning, including its divisions of student affairs, are not exempt from the economic stressors faced in the past decade. Naturally, these divisions and their respective offices have learned to adapt to do more with less. They have continuously been asked to meet a level of expectation through the creation of new initiatives, programs, and trainings that are deemed necessary for student success. It is no secret to those who work in higher education that the relatively slow rate of change is a challenge when attempting to find new approaches to providing quality training programs for our staff. Therefore, we need to begin to broaden and rethink the development and training landscape.</p><blockquote><p>“WE NEED TO BEGIN BY CREATING OPPORTUNITIES TO INITIATE A BLENDED TRAINING-LEARNING PROCESS THAT ALLOWS FOR CONTINUOUS LEARNING AND DEVELOPMENT THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE YEAR… NOT JUST A WEEK AND A HALF OF TRAINING.”</p></blockquote><p>Steve Jobs once said, “Be a yardstick of quality. Some people aren’t used to an environment where excellence is expected.” By changing our schemas on how we train our staff members, we can begin to create quality sessions that are relevant and important to the success of the whole student or professional staff member within their respective roles.</p><p>The ‘how’ of many training and development programs is often not intimately tied to the ‘what’. Change and innovation demand, by their very definition, the visibly new and exciting – the unexpected and the ‘fresh approach’ to an institutional standby. While not an incorrect perspective, the undo emphasis on the visibly new can take away from the deeper and more challenging (and more important) conversations around what our staff need to be trained on. The content wrapped in these innovative icebreakers or technology forward presentations must highlight and respect the various needs and values of our institutions, preparing staff for the job they have now and the inevitable changes to their role in the future.</p><p>If you choose to change the development and training landscape, you must:</p><p><em>Gather information and assessment results from past trainings.</em>Comments, survey results, pre and post tests – these will aid in the understanding of what your staff perceived to be beneficial or necessary, what they want to see more of, what they think needs to be de-emphasized, and more.</p><p><em>Find your developmental focus areas.</em>By understanding what message you are attempting to communicate to your staff through these trainings and how they align with the college’s mission is vital. Think of these as pillars of success. Ask, “What pillars (or areas of focus) do we need to emphasize to grow the whole person and make our staff members effective and efficient at their job?” List them.</p><p><em>List out the developmental focus areas and what training sessions you have done in the past.</em>Once you have gathered information from your assessment results, place past sessions and topics under each specific pillar. If you find there are past sessions that do not naturally fit within a pillar, ask yourself, “Is this session or topic necessary for my staff to know to be successful in their work?” If not, remove it and look for future topics that are similar.</p><p><em>On a separate list identify topics that you feel are necessary for training but have not been facilitated.</em>In all assessments, we must discuss areas of improvement and emerging trends that can have a negative impact on our staff if not appropriately trained.</p><p><em>Edit, crop, and filter.</em>Now that you have discussed past sessions and topics and have identified what trainings or workshops you want to see for your staff – and you have a visual representation of your pillars and how they directly align with your learning outcomes and mission – it is time to discuss and identify which sessions or topics can be facilitated virtually.</p><p><em>Be honest with yourself.</em>Far too often, we find ourselves validating every session and topic we have in our trainings. Doing so is a disservice to ourselves and ours staffs. Our mentality must be, “What is necessary for my staff to do their job well?” Let go of the things in your trainings that simply take up time. We can look at training sessions and firmly believe everything is vital to the success of our program and the development of our staffs. Yet, if we are confident in our ability to recognize what information can be processed independently through online training, we could be efficient in our time management for such extensive in-house trainings.</p><p><em>Platforms and delivery.</em>At this point, you have separated in-house training topics and online topics. Now, we must spend time identifying which communication platform we want to use to deliver the session or topic. There are a number of platforms and programs that can be excellent, free additions to your training bag of tricks. Feel free to explore our<a title="List of Resources for Student Affairs Training" href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0Bweyf2jMAzeQVTVicU1MNlpLejg/edit"><em>compiled list</em></a>of resources.</p><p><em>Create an assessment strategy to determine the effectiveness of a blended learning-training program.</em>By embracing the online and technological side of training and development, we notice that online training is a relatively easy and inexpensive avenue to deliver information and record data.</p><p>Within several sectors of higher education, the need for online training is vital to the success of its departments and programs. Emerging trends within higher education, such as blended training-learning, allow departments and divisions to bring additional intentionality to their in-house trainings and allow for a deeper level of conversation and understanding of the subject matter.</p><p>The bells and whistles of technology can ignite powerful change in our ‘tried and true’ training curriculum. Information can be found faster, our impact can reach farther, and our staff can connect across boundaries that seemed insurmountable only a year ago. However, the attraction of the new is not an invitation for an overhaul of our trainings simply for the sake of keeping up or moving ahead. Each campus, each department, and each program has different and unique needs. Being able to recognize where change is needed is the true measure of an innovative approach to using technology for staff development. While the tools may evolve, our commitment to learning, development, and growth must persist.</p></div></article></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ms-p-h-2vw  colors-light colors-local " data-reactid="49"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ms-bd-r ms-bd-w-1" data-reactid="50"><div class="Group Group-heading ms-p-r-4" data-reactid="51"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="52"><span data-reactid="53"><!-- react-empty: 54 --><h2 class="font-title" data-reactid="55"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="56">Editing, Cropping, and Filtering Trainings</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="57"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="58"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ms-f-s-s w-s-wrap ms-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="59"></div></div></div></section></div></div>
